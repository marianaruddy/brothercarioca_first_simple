                Somos um projeto independente voluntário pensado a partir de
                alunos e para ALUNOS visando a interação e integração dos
                estudantes intercambistas com os alunos locais da PUC-RIO. Em
                2017 juntamos nossos primeiros 14 voluntários fundadores. Todos
                eram recém chegados de intercâmbios e estavam morrendo de
                saudades do mix de culturas que experienciaram por lá. Temos
                como objetivos incentivar trocas culturais através de atividades
                diversas, focadas na construção de relações significativas para
                uma verdadeira experiência carioca. Visamos destacar a
                importância das relações inter-culturais na vivência
                universitária, ser uma rede sem fronteiras, consolidada pelo
                jovem, para o jovem, da PUC para o mundo.
              </p>
              <p>
                Desde a nossa criação, buscamos atender as demandas dos
                intercambistas. Por meio de suas demandas, ao longo dos
                semestres. Hoje, buscamos atividades diversas, que abrangem
                aventuras pela natureza, esportes, eventos sociais e culturais,
                etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                Desde o início, trabalhamos juntamente com a CCCI, sendo parte
                integrante da PUC. A CCCI é uma espécie de “Mãe” para os
                BROTHERS, e nós somos os “irmãos mais velhos” dos nossos irmãos
                internacionais. Se os intercambistas vierem pedir auxílio para
                você (como integrante do Brother Carioca) como dicas de site
                para pesquisar acomodação, assuntos acadêmicos, burocráticos e
                emergenciais, encaminhe eles para o CCCI (Linda e sua
                Equipe)!!!! Caso algum intercambista esteja procurando
                flatmates, sugira nosso grupo do Facebook, onde intercambistas
                fazem posts relacionados ao tema.
